## Task: Building a RESTful API for a TODO App in ASP.NET Core

### Step 1: Set up the Project
- Create a new ASP.NET Core Web API project in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE.
- Choose the appropriate project template for building a Web API.

### Step 2: Define the Model
- Create a C# class representing the TODO item with properties like ID, Title, Description, and IsCompleted.
- Define the database schema or use an existing database to store the TODO items.

### Step 3: Implement CRUD Functionality
- Create a controller class to handle HTTP requests and responses for the TODO items.
- Implement methods for retrieving all TODO items, retrieving a specific TODO item by ID, creating a new TODO item, updating an existing TODO item, and deleting a TODO item.

### Step 4: Define API Endpoints
- Map appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to corresponding controller methods.
- Define the route templates for each endpoint, such as `api/todo` for retrieving all TODO items and `api/todo/{id}` for retrieving a specific TODO item.

### Step 5: Implement Data Validation and Error Handling
- Validate the incoming data for creating and updating TODO items.
- Handle validation errors and return appropriate responses with error messages and status codes.
- Implement global exception handling to provide consistent error responses for unexpected errors.

### Step 6: Implement Filtering and Pagination
- Add support for filtering the TODO items based on criteria like completion status or title.
- Implement pagination to return a subset of TODO items at a time, allowing clients to request specific pages of data.

### Step 7: Add Sorting and Ordering
- Allow clients to sort the TODO items based on different attributes like title or creation date.
- Implement support for ascending and descending order.

### Step 8: Implement Authentication and Authorization
- Apply authentication and authorization middleware to secure the API endpoints.
- Use techniques like token-based authentication (JWT) or OAuth 2.0 to authenticate and authorize API clients.

### Step 9: Document the API
- Use tools like Swagger or OpenAPI to document the API endpoints, request/response models, and available operations.
- Generate interactive API documentation to help other developers understand and use your API.

### Step 10: Test the API
- Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure the API functions correctly and handles different scenarios.
- Use tools like Postman or curl to manually test the API endpoints and verify their behavior.

By following these steps, you will be able to build a robust and functional RESTful API for a TODO app in ASP.NET Core. This task covers essential aspects of API development, including data modeling, CRUD operations, validation, authentication, documentation, and testing.
